        " 3. Select `create an account for free` and follow the instructions to create a free account (or enter your account e-mail if you already have an account).\n",
        " 4. Once your account is active, login and search for `Maestro Viewer` using the search button next to `My Account`. The first search item should be the `Maestro Viewer` link. Click on it and select `Download`, select your laptop's operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux) and proceed to download the software.\n",
        " 5. While the Maestro Viewer is downloading (it's several GB, be patient) study the installation instructions for your operating system. Disregard the part about obtaining a license: it's included in the installer.\n",
        " 6. Follow the installation instructions and try starting the Maestro Viewer once the software download is complete.\n",
        " 7. As a convenience, the Maestro Viewer installers are also available at this [Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/znlw50pi5i5ej0sw8l62w/ALHlxl5OerjQ-X206dzQJG0?rlkey=fxnbnum5ndpf181z4uhilqryo&st=v16o2hic&dl=0). However, do not share this link outside class, we do not have permission to redistribute Schrodinger's software.\n"
