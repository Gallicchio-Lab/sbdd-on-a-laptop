At the bottom of the cell, enter the sequence of the protein from the FASTA file of the HPK1 protein and the SMILES of one of the ligands assigned to you in the previous session (`2.1 Retrieve Ligand Smiles from CHEMBL`). Click `Confirm` when done.\n","5. Scroll down to `Run Prediction` and execute the `Create YAML file from the input data` and `Run prediction using Boltz-2` cells.\n","6.
